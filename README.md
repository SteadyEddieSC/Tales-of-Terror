# Terror Turn (working title)

A controller-first, 1–8 player digital horror board-game adventure with shared-screen play, shifting alliances, meaningful afterlife roles, an adaptive Underteller/Director, and optional browser companion devices.

> **Repository note:** The repository remains `SteadyEddieSC/Tales-of-Terror` until the working title receives a careful trademark, storefront, domain, and common-law review. An informal search is not legal clearance.

## Current priorities

1. Preserve the Godot 4.7 controller/display, visual, exploration, Living Board, rules, Director, social-role, and companion authority foundations.
2. Use the v0.0.9 fake transport, local Worker emulation, and browser lab to keep stable-seat privacy and exactly-once intent boundaries regression-tested.
3. Build the v0.1.0 first vertical slice without moving gameplay authority into the relay or browser.
4. Defer production Cloudflare deployment, accounts, matchmaking, persistence, full remote play, and security certification until their own reviewed gates.

## Foundation decisions

- Godot 4.7 stable, typed GDScript, Compatibility renderer.
- 960×540 logical world viewport, 16:9 output, scalable high-resolution UI.
- Windows and Linux first; Batocera validation through Linux builds.
- Shared camera by default; split screen only for specific modes or mini-games.
- Native Godot host remains authoritative in early online-capable releases.
- No normal-length mode leaves eliminated players inactive.

## Repository map

- `game/` — Godot project
- `docs/gdd/` — canonical living Game Design Document
- `docs/technical/` — project setup and architecture
- `docs/decisions/` — design/architecture decision records
- `art/` and `audio/` — source and exports
- `web/companion/` — accessible browser companion prototype
- `services/room-service/` — ephemeral Cloudflare-compatible room coordinator

## Documentation rule

Markdown is canonical for Git history. Polished DOCX snapshots are generated at meaningful milestones and retained in the starter package or tagged release artifacts. The long-term choice between Git LFS and Release attachments is recorded before v0.0.3.

## License status

The repository is public, but no final reuse license has been selected. The intended direction is source-available and noncommercial rather than an OSI open-source license. See `LICENSE-DECISION.md`.
